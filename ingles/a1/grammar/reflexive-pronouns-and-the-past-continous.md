## Reflixive Prononus


We use reflexive pronouns when the action affects the same subject who performs it.

-   I love myself.
-   You put yourself in danger.
-   He looks at himself.

When a person does something on their own:

-   I myself did all these things.
-   She did the project by herself.

## Past Continuous

We use the past continuous to describe things that were happening at a specific moment in the past:

`+`    **Subject + verb be in past + verb ing + complement.** She was walking when she saw herself in the mirror.

`-`    **Subject + verb be in past + not + verb ing + complement.** They weren’t cooking when the food burned.

`?`    **Wh + verb be in past + subject + verb ing + complement + ?**
